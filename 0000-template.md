## Summary

Brief explanation of the feature.

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this RFC is not accepted, the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions. In other words, enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too closely to the solution you have in mind.

## Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with ReScript to understand, and for somebody familiar with the implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be defined here.

## Drawbacks

Why should we not do this? Please consider:

- implementation cost, both in term of code size and complexity
- whether the proposed feature can be implemented in user space
- the impact on teaching people ReScript
- integration of this feature with other existing and planned features
- cost of migrating existing ReScript codebase (is it a breaking change?)

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

## Rationale and alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?
- If this is a language proposal, could this be done in a library instead?

## Prior art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal. A few examples of what this can include are:

- For language, library, tools, and compiler proposals: Does this feature exist in other programming languages and what experience has their community had?
- For community proposals: Is this done by some other community and what were their experiences with it?
- For other teams: What lessons can we learn from what other communities have done here?
- Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If you have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed theoretical background.

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other languages and provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture. If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from other languages.

Note that while precedent set by other languages is some motivation, it does not on its own motivate an RFC.

## Adoption strategy

If we implement this proposal, how will existing ReScript developers adopt it? Is this a breaking change? What is the migration plan? Should we coordinate with other projects or libraries?

## Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still TBD?

## Future posibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and how it would affect the language and project as a whole in a holistic way. Try to use this section as a tool to more fully consider all possible interactions with the project and language in your proposal.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFC you are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities, you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section is not a reason to accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be in the section on motivation or rationale in this or subsequent RFCs. The section merely provides additional information.
